# Variables

Now, we're talking about how to declaring a variable on Java.

you can declare a variable on Java using the following syntax.

```java
var name String = "hello";
```

Now to repeat what we've done, `var` means that we're declaring a variable, `name` is the identifier of the variable and `String` is the data type of the variable.

Of course, we can also just declare a variable without having to input the data.

```java
var name String;
```

Java does have some datatypes that we can use to declare variables, for example:

- String = "hello"
- Integer or int = 123
- Boolean = true
- Long = 123
- Float = 1.0

And much more.
