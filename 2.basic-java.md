# Basic Java

to start of, you can make a "Hello world" by creating `main.java` file in your project and type this into your code.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}
```

remember that in every line of your code, you have to end it with semicolon (;).

`public class Main` means that you making a public class with `Main` as the name of.

`public static void main(String[] args)` means that you make a public void that is static (only to run the function) and return `String[] args` for the params, of course you **MUST** add it!
