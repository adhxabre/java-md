# Access Modifier

Remember that we're making a class using `public`?
Now, we`re gonna learn what is **Access Modifier** is.

`public` means that we can access the class, constructor, variables, methods, or data members anywhere without restriction.

`private` means that we cannot access the class (we only can access/apply it when it's on nested classes), method name, or data members.

We also have `protected` and `package-private` access modifiers, but in this e-book, we won't talk about it because we will ofter use `public` and `private` only.

## Cases

### **Public**

<hr />

```java
public class Myclass;

public Name string;
```

### **Private**

```java
private class Chemicals;

private CO2 string;
```
